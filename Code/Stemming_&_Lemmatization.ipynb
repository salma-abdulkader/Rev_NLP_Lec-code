-Play- we used to hide under the cover serenade each other with careless melody something buried deep inside u the major and the minor we 're like piano key you played for me x3 i swear it even in my sleep i hear it like the memory of every thing we used to be you played for me could n't stop the world from turning it wa like a whirlwind scattered u like leaf but i 'm stuck inside a feeling the song that never leaf we were like a symphony you played for me x3 i swear it even in my sleep i hear it like the memory of every thing we used to be you played for me i swear it even in my sleep i hear it like the memory of every thing we used to be you played for me -Different world- All we know Left untold Beaten by a broken dream Nothing like what it used to be ( used to be ) We 've been chasing our demon down an empty road Been watching our castle turning into dust Escaping our shadow just to end up here Once more And we both know This is not the world we had in mind But we got time We are stuck on answer we ca n't find But we got time And even though we might have lost tonight The skyline reminds u of a different time This is not the world we had in mind But we got time Broken smile , tired eye I can feel your longing heart Call my name , howling from afar We 've been fighting our demon just to stay afloat Been building a castle just to watch it fall Been running forever just to end up here Once more And now we know This is not the world we had in mind But we got time We are stuck on answer we ca n't find But we got time And even though we might have lost tonight The skyline reminds u of a different time This is not the world we had in mind But we got time Take me back Back to the mountainside Under the Northern Lights Chasing the star Take me back Back to the mountainside When we were full of life Back to the start And we both know that This is not the world we had in mind But we got time We are stuck on answer we ca n't find But we got time And even though we might have lost tonight The skyline reminds u of a different time This is not the world we had in mind But we got time -Unity- In the dark of night The star light up the sky We see them flying free That 's just like you and me Everyone is lonely sometimes But I would walk a thousand mile to see your eye You are not alone , we are family Hold me , let 's escape all this reality You are my symphony By your side , we are unity You are my energy My guiding light , we are unity ( We are , we are ) We are unity ( We are , we are ) We are unity Although the rain might pour A thunder start to roar The lightning wake the wave But through it , we are brave Everyone is lonely sometimes But I would walk a thousand mile to see your eye You are not alone , we are family Hold me , let 's escape all this reality You are my symphony By your side , we are unity ( We are unity ) You are my energy My guiding light , we are unity ( We are , we are ) We are unity ( We are , we are ) We are unity We are unity You are my symphony ( We are ) By your side ( We are , we are unity , unity ) You are my energy My guiding light ( We are unity ) We are unity We are unity -Force- Wait a second let
